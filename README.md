What is Server?

A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client.
In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server. That machine might be a dedicated server or it might be used   for other purposes.In the client/server programming model, a server program awaits and fulfills requests from client programs, which might be running in the same, or other computers. A given application in a computer might function as a client with requests for services from other programs and as a server of requests from other programs.

Types of servers
Servers are often categorized in terms of their purpose. A few examples of the types of servers available are as follows:

- Web server: A computer program that serves requested HTML pages or files. In this case, a web browser acts as the client.
- Application server: A program in a computer in a distributed network that provides the business logic for an application program.
- Proxy server: Software that acts as an intermediary between an endpoint device, such as a computer, and another server from which a user or client is requesting a service.
- Mail server: An application that receives incoming emails from local users -- people within the same domain -- and remote senders and forwards outgoing emails for delivery.
- Virtual server: A program running on a shared server that is configured in such a way that it seems to each user that they have complete control of a server.
- Blade server: A server chassis housing multiple thin, modular electronic circuit boards, known as server blades. Each blade is a server in its own right, often dedicated to a single application
- File server: A computer responsible for the central storage and management of data files so that other computers on the same network can access them.
- Policy server: A security component of a policy-based network that provides authorization services and facilitates tracking and control of files. 
- Database server: This server is responsible for hosting one or more databases. Client applications perform database queries that retrieve data from or write data to the database that is hosted on the server.
- Print server: this server provides users with access to one or more network-attached printers -- or print devices as some server vendors call them. The print server acts as a queue for the print jobs that users submit. Some print servers can prioritize the jobs in the print queue based on the job type or on who submitted the print job.

  
What is a JS Server?

A guy named **Brendan Eich**, who was working at Netscape at the time, was tasked to create a scripting language to add a bit of interactivity to their Netscape Navigator browser. The language would be created to compete with a similar scripting language called JScript of the same era, which came from Microsoft for its Internet Explorer browser. Interactivity meant being able to do basic validation on an input for a form and do something when a button is clicked. Eich created the first version of JavaScript in 10 days. Yeah, just 10 days.

Fast-forward a couple of years later, Google had its map service that was making really advanced use of the language, using **XMLHTTPRequest to update their map in real-time** while users were navigating around. That contributed to the popularity of the language because it showed what was possible in a browser at the time. The **AJAX** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) term was coined around that time and was becoming a popular technique to get new data on a web page without reloading it and this quickly became a common use of the technology.

Then in **2009, another guy named Ryan Dahl created Node.js,** which we will discuss in the next section.
